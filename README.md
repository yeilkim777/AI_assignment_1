Both backtrack and local search files use the same input method, open(sys.argv[1], 'r'), to accept whatever text file you may wish to use.
In the terminal, simply:
1. cd [file path to wherever you're storing the .py file]
2. type in the line: python file.py map while 'file' is the name of one of our search .py files and 'map' is the name of the map input text file - please don't type '.txt' at the end, as it will think that it is a different kind of file
